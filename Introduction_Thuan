Markers is a simple drawing program similar to Acrylic Paint above, but with perhaps slightly more options. 
What sets Markers apart, however, is that it can take advantage of capacitive screens. 
Capacitive screens are those capable of measuring difference in pressure from your finger or stylus, 
allowing you to push harder for a thicker line or more lightly for a thinner one, 
not all that differently than the way one expects drawing to work with analog equivalents like pencils and paint brushes in the real world. 
You must have a capacitive screen to take advantage of this feature (hint: some phones don't have one),
but the app may still work fine even for those with â€˜normal' screens.
